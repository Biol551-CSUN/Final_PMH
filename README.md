>This is my Final Independent project

My Final project is about the national parks visitors in united States, which is going to include a small introduction about national parks, corresponding links associated with national park service and a list of the national parks in US divided by states.


## National Parks
On August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the "Organic Act" creating the National Park Service, a federal bureau in the Department of the Interior responsible for maintaining national parks and monuments that were then managed by the department. The National Park System has since expanded to 423 units (often referred to as parks), more than 150 related areas, and numerous programs that assist in conserving the nation's natural and cultural heritage for the benefit of current and future generations.(national park gov)
